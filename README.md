The light bulb project simulates turning a light bulb on and off using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It typically involves an image of a bulb that changes between an "on" and "off" state when clicked. JavaScript handles the logic to switch the bulb's image source based on the current state. This project is a great beginner exercise to understand event handling in JavaScript. It visually demonstrates the impact of user interaction on a webpage.
